# 3D, 2D and 1D physical benchmark catchment models

## About the repository

This GitHub repository includes implementation of physical benchmark catchment models formulated and used in three-part paper "On the development and analysis of coupled
surface-subsurface models of catchments" by P. Morawiecki and P.H. Trinh. Two main models are implemented:
* 3D/2D hillslope model - describes evolution of pressure head $h_g(x,y,z,t)$ and surface water height $h_s(x,z,t)$ in a 3D hillslope in a tilted V-shape catchment. Implemented using Finite Volume Method. The model is presented in "Part 2. A three-dimensional benchmark model and its properties" [[1]](#1).
* 1D hillslope model - describes evolution of total groundwater and surface water depth $H_g(x,t)$ in hillslopes characterised by a thin soil layer. It is implemented numerically using 1D PDE solver and a range of analytic and semi-analytic approximations are available. The model is presented in "Part 3. Analytical solutions and scaling laws" [[2]](#2).

Apart from implementation of above models, the repository also includes codes that can be used to recreate figures from two papers cited above. The visual appearance of the figures is different than in paper, since for the published version the output data were illustrated using LaTeX TikZ library.

## Repository content

When finalised the repository will include following directories:

* MODELS - implementation of 2D/3D and 1D model with additional functions
* RESULTS - directory for storing output datasets
* FIGURES - directory for storing output figures

The main directory includes the following examples:
